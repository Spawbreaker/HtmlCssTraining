    <h1>
      This is a sample to show inline CSS doesn't work on multiple header 1s. It
      is, instead, pulling from the external css.
    </h1>
    <!-- It gets kinda annoying to do it -->
    <!-- Now we're gonna use internal css! -->
    <h2>We're learning a lot</h2>
    <h2>All of these header 2s get changed at the same time!</h2>
    <h2>It's super powerful!</h2>
    <!-- Now, let's use external css! -->
    <h3>This is external css handled by another file</h3>
    <h3>
      This is cool because we can pull it for multiple pages without having to
      copy-paste it.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      <a href="./about.html"
        >Let's go to the about page to see this in action!</a
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      But, it's important to note. The priority for the browser to load the
      styles on is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Inline</li>
      <li>Internal</li>
      <li>External</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      So it's likely that you can mix and match with them to do something cool.
